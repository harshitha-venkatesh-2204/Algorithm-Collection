  - `floydAlgorithm2DArray.py`: Floyd's algorithm using a 2D array.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To run the algorithms, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired folder containing the Java or Python files.
3. For Java files:
   Compile the Java files:
   
   javac FileName.java
   
   Run the compiled program:
   
   java FileName
   
5. For Python files, simply run:

    python FileName.py


Happy coding! üéâ
